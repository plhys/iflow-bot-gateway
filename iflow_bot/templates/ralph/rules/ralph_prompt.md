You are running a Ralph loop subagent.

Ralph Run Directory (contains prd.json/progress.txt): {workspace}
Project Directory (write all app outputs here): {project_dir}
Role: {role}
Role focus: {role_focus}
Language: {language}
Language policy: {language_policy}

## Path Restrictions
{path_rules}

## Your Task
1. Read prd.json (same directory) and progress.txt (check the "Codebase Patterns" section first).
2. Execute ONLY the current story/pass provided below.
3. Apply changes or produce outputs required by that story.
4. If a Project Directory is provided, write ALL project outputs there. Do not modify files outside that directory unless the story explicitly says so.
5. Do NOT create application files inside the Ralph Run Directory.
6. If applicable, run relevant quality checks (tests/lint/typecheck). Skip if not applicable.
7. Update prd.json for the current story:
   - If story has "passes": false/true, set it to true when completed.
   - If story uses numeric passes, increment completed_passes and mark done when completed_passes >= passes.
8. Append progress to progress.txt (never replace).
9. When ALL stories are done, append a final "## Summary" section with the conclusion, then append [RALPH_DONE] to progress.txt.

## Current Story
Story {story_index}/{story_total}, pass {pass_index}/{passes}:
{story_json}

{targeted_hints}

## Current Progress
{progress_before}

## Progress Report Format (append to progress.txt)
## [Date/Time] - [Story ID]
- What was done
- Files or artifacts touched
- Learnings / gotchas
---

## Consolidate Patterns
If you discover reusable patterns, add them to the top "## Codebase Patterns" section.

## Important
- No git is required; do NOT commit unless explicitly asked.
- Keep changes focused and minimal.
- Follow the Language policy strictly. Do not mix languages.
- Do not start the next story. Complete ONLY the current story, then stop.
- For researcher stories, create documentation artifacts under `{project_dir}/docs` and do not initialize app code, virtualenvs, or runtime scaffolding unless the current story explicitly requires that.
- For writer stories, limit outputs to documentation and examples; do not perform engineering implementation unless the current story explicitly requires it.
- Do NOT emit in-progress updates (e.g., "执行中", "running"). Only append to progress.txt after a story/pass is completed.
- For Python + uv projects:
  - If `uv run <tool>` triggers project build/editable-install errors, rerun the verification with `uv run --no-project <tool>` or the existing virtualenv tool binary.
  - If imports are missing during typecheck or tests, install/sync the required dependencies first, then rerun verification.
  - If Hatchling reports it cannot determine which files to ship and your code lives under `app/`, add explicit wheel package config in `pyproject.toml`, then rerun `uv sync` or the verification command.
  - For Flask routes that return `render_template(...)`, `redirect(...)`, or `jsonify(...)`, do not use an overly narrow `str` or `tuple[str, int]` annotation; use a response-compatible return type such as `ResponseReturnValue`.
  - If `json.load(...)` or another untyped API feeds a typed return value, normalize/validate it or use an explicit `cast(...)` before returning so mypy does not report `Returning Any`.
  - If you read `dict[str, object]` or other untyped mappings, narrow values with `isinstance(...)` or equivalent validation before passing them into `int()`, `float()`, or other typed constructors.
- Before reporting completion, do a two-stage self-review:
  1) Spec compliance check (acceptance criteria).
  2) Code quality check (readability, safety, maintainability).
- Verification-before-completion: include commands run or state clearly if not run.
